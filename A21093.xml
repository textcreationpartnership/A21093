            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A COVRANTE OF NEWES FROM THE EAST INDIA.</head>
            <head type="sub">A true Relation of the taking of the Ilands of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore</hi> and <hi>Polaroone</hi> in the parts of <hi>Banda</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which Ilands had yeelded themſelues ſubiect vnto the King of <hi>England.</hi> Written to the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company in <hi>England</hi> from their Factors there.</head>
            <p>ABout the Month of December 1620. the Dutch Generall hauing prepared a force of 16. ſhips, declared to our <hi>Preſident,</hi> that he intended an exploit for the good of both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, without mentioning any particulars of his deſignes.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing vs to haue no ſuch forces ready to ioyne with him, he ſayd he would attempt it alone. And the third of Ianuary. 1620. he did ſet ſale from <hi>Iaquatra</hi> with his ſayd forces, and arriued at <hi>Banda</hi> about the third of February following.</p>
            <p>Preſently vpon his arriuall he made great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration againſt the Iland of <hi>Lantore,</hi> which Iland was formerly by the inhabitants thereof deliuered ouer vnto our people for the vſe, and vnder the ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Kings Maieſtie</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whereof our Captaine of the Ile of <hi>Polaroone</hi> had taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and had alſo ſetled a factory there.</p>
            <p>When our chiefe Factor in our ſayd Ile of <hi>Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roone</hi> heard of the purpoſe of the Dutch Generall againſt the ſayd Ile of <hi>Lantore,</hi> he wrote a letter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14318:2"/>the ſayd Generall, aduiſing him that the ſayd Ile of <hi>Lantore</hi> did belong vnto the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that therefore hee ſhould not attempt any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt it, ſeeing there is an accord made in England betweene vs. Which letter, the ſayd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall threw from him in a great rage ſcarce vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeing to reade it ouer, and cauſed the Meſſenger to be thruſt out of doores, requiring him to aduiſe our Factor of <hi>Polaroone</hi> preſently to ſend to <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore;</hi> and fetch away all ſuch of our people and goods as were vpon that Iland; for whomſoeuer he ſhould find there: he would take them as his vtter enemies, and they ſhould fare no better then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>And within ten or twelue dayes after he landed all his forces there, &amp; ſubdued the ſaid Iland. So long as the fight endured, our Factors and feruants there (being three <hi>Engliſh</hi> and eight <hi>Chineces</hi>) kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within doores, and afterwards our people came out of their houſes, and told them, the houſe wherein they were, was the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe, and that therefore they ſhould not meddle therewith.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe they ſacked our houſe, tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all our goods, murthered three of our <hi>Chines</hi> ſeruants, bound the reſt (as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Chineſſes</hi>) hand &amp; foote, &amp; threatned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cut their throats binding them three ſeuerall times to ſeuerall ſtakes with their weapons ready drawne out, and did put a halter vpon our principall Factors necke, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp his head, and ſtretching out his necke, ready to put them to death, yet did not execute them, but as they were bound hand and foote (as aforeſayd) tumbled them downe ouer the rockes like dogs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14318:2"/>and like to haue broken their neckes, and thus bound, carryed them aboord their ſhips, and there kept them priſoners in Irons 14. or 16. dayes.</p>
            <p>After the conqueſt of the Iland of <hi>Lantore</hi> the Dutch Generall threatned to doe the like vnto <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laroone</hi> wherefore our principall Factor of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laroone</hi> being there but newly arriued, went vnto the Dutch Generall vnto the caſtle of <hi>Nera,</hi> and told him that he heard that he purpoſed to take <hi>Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roone</hi> by force, which hee could not beleeue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his owne meſſenger ſent to <hi>Polaroone</hi> to ſpeake with our Factors, had giuen it out alſo, that the General himſelfe ſhould ſay, that if the Engliſh did not come preſently vnto him &amp; yeeld the ſayd fort of <hi>Polaroone</hi> vnto him, he would ſend his forces, and ouer-run all the countrey, but hoped he would enterprize no ſuch thing againſt that place, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Articles of agreement, and knowing how many yeeres (to the great loſſe and charge of the company) we held poſſeſſion and maintained the place to the vſe of his Maieſty of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſayd Generall made little anſwer to it, as though there were no ſuch matter intended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our ſayd Factot tooke his leaue &amp; came away.</p>
            <p>But the next day hee was followed to <hi>Polaroone</hi> with and <hi>Armado</hi> of 26. <hi>Prowes</hi> &amp; one ſhip, which did put the inhabitants of <hi>Polaroone</hi> in ſuch a feare, as they knew not what to do; whereupon our chiefe Factor there asked the commander of thoſe forces, what his purpoſe was with ſuch a fleete there, and that if he attempted any thing againſt <hi>Polaroone,</hi> it was a breach of the Articles it being in our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This could not preuaile with him, but ſayd the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14318:3"/>land was theirs, and they would haue it by faire meanes or force, and as for our profeſſion, they would not acknowledge it (the inhabitants and not we being maiſters of the place) and ſo the Dutch Commander went a ſhore vnto the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the ſaid inhabitants asked vs if we could and would defend them, but perceiuing wee were not able to defend our ſelues, much leſſe to ſecure them: they were forced to yeeld themſelues and the Iland into his hands.</p>
            <p>The Dutch tooke downe the Engliſh colours, and ſet vp their owne, and cauſed the inhabitants preſently to bring in all their weapons, and to throw downe all their walles, and would haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to haue taken all our Ordnance out of our Fort, which they at the firſt refuſed to doe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leding that they had formerly giuen and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred the land to the King of England, and in reſpect they had liued ſo long with the Engliſh, they would not now offer vs any iniury or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>And when our chiefe Factor went a ſhore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate the matter with the Dutch Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he could obtaine nothing at his hands, but that the land was theirs, and things muſt bee ſo, and ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>Whereupon our ſayd Factor went again vnto the Dutch General to the caſtle of <hi>Nera</hi> to conferre with him thereabouts, but he would giue no other anſwer, but that he had referred thoſe buſineſſes to his ſayd Lieutenant ſent thither, with whom hee might conferre: who in the abſenſe of our ſayd chiefe Factor, had brought ſome of his ſouldiers a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14318:3"/>ſhore vpon <hi>Polaroone,</hi> and forced the Ilanders to throw all our Ordnance ouer the rocke from the place where they were planted (being nine peeces) whereof foure broke with the fall, and were all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away by the Dutch.</p>
            <p>Moreouer our Captaine of <hi>Polaroone</hi> who had defended the Iland foure yeeres together going to <hi>Lantore</hi> (at the requeſt of the inhabitants) to receiue the ſurrendry thereof for our Kings Maieſties vſe (as aforeſaid) and returning backe againe about the beginning of <hi>Nouember</hi> 1620. was ſlaine by the Dutch. And it is very probable, they did it after the time they had intelligence of the publication of the accord at <hi>Bantam</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1619. For preſently vpon the ſaid publication, they ſent ſecretly to the Ilands in thoſe parts, where they had trade, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs of our part of the ſpices due vnto vs by the accord.</p>
            <p>After the ſaid Dutch Generall had ſubdued the fore mentioned Iland of <hi>Lantore,</hi> he conſtrained them to deliuer vnto him, the principall of all their children for hoſtages: Then he tooke away from them all their ſmall veſſels and boats, and then he alſo required all the men of <hi>Lantore</hi> to be brought vnto him, and they brought him all the prncipall men, but this did not ſatisfie him, but he would haue al the <hi>Bandineſſes,</hi> which had ayded them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all their wiues and children, ſmall and great to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e brought as priſoners aboord his ſhips.</p>
            <p>Which when the <hi>Bandineſſes</hi> perceiued doubting <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he meant to make them all ſlaues and to carry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14318:4"/>them to ſome other places) they agreed together to retire themſelues into the higheſt and ſtrongeſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the land, and there did fortifie themſelues, whereupon the Dutch ſlue of them and tooke 1200 perſons priſoners, moſt of them being women and children, which they haueſince carryed to <hi>Iaquatra</hi> and other places.</p>
